Major bugs: my-malloc can be used when run most programs in Ians computer.
            However, when I use my-malloc in my (Cheko)  computer, I get a segmentation 
            fault whenever I include the -l option in ls. Other programs work well. Even ls with
            the a option does not have any issues.
